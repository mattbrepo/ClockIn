# ClockIn
Super simple utility to track your time.

**Language: C#**

**Start: 2018**

## Why
I needed to keep track of my time in an wasy way. This simple program does it on a CSV file that will allow me to extract working patterns in the future (if I ever want to).

## Example
![Example](/images/example.jpg)

The GUI shows:
* the current activity (_activity 1_)
* the time spent on the current activity (_1:54_)
* the daily total active time (_2:08_)
* the daily time spent on every activity (_working: 00:13_, _activity 1: 01:54_)

The GUI has a button to _Clock in_ and _Clock out_ and anothor to open the simple CSV database.
